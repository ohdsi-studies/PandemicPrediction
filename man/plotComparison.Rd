\arguments{
\item{allResults}{Data frame containing all results}

\item{modelOriginsToCompare}{Vector of model origins to compare (e.g., c("New Covid", "Original Influenza"))}

\item{featureSetsToCompare}{Vector of feature sets to compare (e.g., c("Parsimonious", "Full"))}

\item{devPeriodsToCompare}{Optional vector of development periods to compare (e.g., c("First 3 Months", "Full Year 2020"))}

\item{facetBy}{Optional vector of column names to facet by (e.g., c("outcomeName"))}

\item{metric}{Metric to plot (default is "AUROC")}

\item{legendCorner}{Position of the legend ("tl", "tr", "bl", "br", or "auto")
where "auto" places the legend to avoid overlapping data points. Default is "auto".}

\item{vaccineLineColor}{Color for vaccine milestone lines (default is "#EF4444FF")}

\item{variantLineColor}{Color for variant milestone lines (default is "#9CA3AFFF}

\item{title}{Optional title for the plot}

\item{outcome}{Outcome name to filter by ("Death", "Critical", "Hospital")}

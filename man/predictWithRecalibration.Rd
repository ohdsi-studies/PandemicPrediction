\title{A custom prediction function that applies stored recalibration coefficients.}
\usage{
predictWithRecalibration(plpModel, data, cohort)
}
\arguments{
\item{plpModel}{The plpModel object. This object is expected to have a
                   `$recalibration` list containing `$coefficients`. Which are
the weak recalibration intercept and gradient.}

\item{data}{An object of type `plpData`.}

\item{cohort}{The cohort to predict on.}
}
\value{
A prediction data frame with the recalibrated risk values.
}
\description{
This function is designed to be called by `PatientLevelPrediction::predictPlp`.
It first calls the model's original prediction function (e.g., `predictGlm`)
and then applies a weak recalibration transformation using coefficients
stored on the plpModel object itself. In addition to returning calibrated
probabilities in the `value` column, this function also returns a
`linearPredictor` column so that rank-based metrics (e.g., AUROC) can be
computed on the linear predictor when available.
